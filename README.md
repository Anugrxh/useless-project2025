# KERALA ROAD SURVIVALüéØ

### Project Description
An AI-powered system that takes an image of a road and magically figures out the safest path to drive or ride without hitting a single pothole ‚Äî because apparently, swerving in style is the new trend. We have trained the AI Model with the pathole dataset to recognize and label the patholes and then uses A* Algorithm for finding the safest path without hitting the pothole. and developed a flask API for this and connect it with a reactJS frontend using the RestAPI.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes you‚Äôre riding your bike and you accidentally avoid potholes. Boring. We wanted to make sure you avoid them strategically with the precision of a GPS-guided missile ‚Äî even though your eyes work just fine.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We trained an AI to look at a road, find every pothole, and chart a ‚Äúroyal procession‚Äù route around them. It uses pathfinding algorithms normally reserved for video games, because why not make avoiding potholes feel like winning a level in Mario Kart?
