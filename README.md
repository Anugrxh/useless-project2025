### Project Description
An AI-powered system that takes an image of a road and magically figures out the safest path to drive or ride without hitting a single pothole ‚Äî because apparently, swerving in style is the new trend.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes you‚Äôre riding your bike and you accidentally avoid potholes. Boring. We wanted to make sure you avoid them strategically with the precision of a GPS-guided missile ‚Äî even though your eyes work just fine.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We trained an AI to look at a road, find every pothole, and chart a ‚Äúroyal procession‚Äù route around them. It uses pathfinding algorithms normally reserved for video games, because why not make avoiding potholes feel like winning a level in Mario Kart?
